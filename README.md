# Train_NN_with_Tensorboard

Tensordboard is an useful tool to check the state of our train process. This repo gives a simple instance to show how to use tensorboard to train our neural network with pytorch. More infomation could be find [here](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_38709804/article/details/103922830).
